To reproduce GeneFishing results in GTEx tissues:
1. Create a folder on your laptop, download all the content of this repository (DO NOT forget the data folder, the c1.csv records the id of the 21 bait genes).
2. Please go to https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18434549/files/ and download the normalized.GTex.with.ncRNA.median.larger.than.0.1.RData into the data sub-folder.
3. Run fishing.in.GTex.data.R.


Tips:
1. You may need to install some R packages (such as dplyr, foreach, LICORS, doParallel) before running the script,.
2. It is highly recommended that you run the script on a server, instead of your own laptop.
3. Please contact keliu.iluke@gmail.com if you have any questions. Any suggestions and comments are also welcomed.


Files:
data/c1.csv: the 21 cholesterol bio-synthesis pathway genes, used as bait genes in the paper.
data/immune.bait.csv: newly-identified 16 bait genes related to immune system, used in the rebuttal letter.



To run GeneFishing on your gene expression dataset:
1. Load your gene expression data into a R matrix object (here suppose the name of the matrix is sample.expr.matrix)
2. Load your pre-defined bait gene into a R vector object (here suppose the name of the vectpr is sample.bait.gene)
3. Call the function like this:

source('gene.fishing.package.R')
require(dplyr)
require(foreach)
require(doParallel)
registerDoParallel(40)
fish.freq.df <- do.gene.fishing(bait.gene = sample.bait.gene,expr.matrix = sample.expr.matrix,alpha=5,fishing.round=1000)

The tuning paramater alpha is used to control the size of the subsearch space. Say, suppose you have n bait genes, then the  size will be (1+alpha) * n.
