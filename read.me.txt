To reproduce GeneFishing results in GTEx tissues:
1. Create a folder on your laptop, download all the content of this repository (DO NOT forget the data folder, the c1.csv records the id of the 21 bait genes).
2. Please go to https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18434549/files/ to download the normalized.GTex.with.ncRNA.median.larger.than.0.1.RData  into the data sub-folder.
3. Run the fishing.in.GTex.data.R.



Tips:
1. You may need to install some R packages (such as dplyr, foreach, LICORS, doParallel) before running the script,.
2. It is highly recommended that you run the script on a server, instead of your own laptop.
3. Please contact keliu.iluke@gmail.com if you have any questions. Any feedback and comments are also warmly welcome.
